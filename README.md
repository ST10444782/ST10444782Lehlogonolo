The History App's goal is to give users a way to quickly locate well-known people who passed away at certain ages. When a user enters an age, the app uses a predefined list of historical individuals to identify a renowned person who passed away at that age. The app offers users an enjoyable way to learn about famous people throughout history and wants to be clear, easy to use, and informative, which encourages historical literacy and a deeper understanding of human achievements.
User Interface (UI): The UI has a simple, user-friendly design. There is just one form for users to enter their age and a button to start the search. The User Interface(UI): can only cater for numerical values and it must be a whole number, it does not handle numbers that are put in words. 
There's also a clear button in case you need to reset the app. To guarantee ease of use and rapid access to the app's main features, the user interface has been kept basic. 

Functionality: The main purpose of the app is to find a well-known individual who died at a certain age. The app uses a list of well-known people and their ages when they passed away to accomplish this. Kotlin is used to create the logic for searching this list, making it possible to efficiently retrieve pertinent data in response to user input.Because it is written in kotlin which is mostly used for android apps, the History app is only built for the Android platform.So as result of that OS like iOS devices cannot download the app. 
Error management: To provide an enjoyable experience for users, the app has handling of errors features. The correct error messages are displayed to guide the user in case they enter an invalid age or if there is no known person found at the given age. There's also a clear button to restart a new search or reset the app if something goes wrong.

Scalability: By allowing the addition of more well-known people to the set list, the app is made to be easily accessible. This ensures that the app will always be current and that it will be able to support a broader range of historical individuals as needed. Also, the codebase's generic and maintainable nature makes it easier to update and improve in the future.
How GitHub and GitHub Actions are Used: 

The History App design and execution process makes use of GitHub and GitHub Actions for enhanced version control, automated testing, and teamwork.


Git version control: The project is located on GitHub, offering a central repository for maintaining and keeping track of the source code. Version control with Git enables developers to keep track of changes, work together efficiently, and preserve the entirety of the project's history.
Collaboration: GitHub lets team members work together by letting them work on separate projects, make changes, and combine them together in a way that's simple to use. To ensure code quality and consistency, proposed changes are reviewed and discussed via pull requests prior to being integrated into the main branch. Issue Tracking: To manage tasks, track defects, and prioritize work, use GitHub's issue tracking function. Feature requests, bug reports, and other project-related tasks are recorded in issues, which serve as a primary hub for coordination and communication.
GitHub Actions: Automated testing and continuous integration are two uses for GitHub Actions. When changes are pushed to the repository, workflow files are set up to automatically launch builds, run tests, and carry out other predetermined tasks. This facilitates the development process, assures code quality, and finds problems early. 

Documentation: Project documentation, such as installation instructions, usage recommendations, and development resources, is kept up to date using GitHub's integrated wiki functionality. This promotes cooperation and knowledge sharing by ensuring that project information is easily accessible to team members and contributors.
